        <h2>Baker, turned Marketer, turned <b>Programmer.</b></h2>
            <p>My name is Avalon Stanley, and I am literally <em>obsessed</em> 
            with creative problem solving and its seemingly 
            endless possibilities...I thrive in an environment that 
            challenges the norm, and pushes boundaries.<br><br>Less than 
            a year ago, I made the crazy decision to go back to school 
            and study Software Engineering Technology in my 30's...and with 3 kids at home! 
            But after I learned to code my first 'Hello World' 
            application, I was immediately entranced by the unmistakeable 
            pull and magical feeling that it gave me.<br><br>Since then, I've 
            dived deep into learning all that I can, and put into 
            practice much of what I've been taught. Still new, and 
            eager to learn, I'm ready and excited for whatever challenges 
            come my way...because through challenge is where real growth occurs!</p>
